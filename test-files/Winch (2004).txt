Abstract

    Construction project planning is receiving growing attention as the limitations of formal deterministic planning are becoming
more widely recognised. In particular, the last planner and critical chain approaches are diﬀusing rapidly. However, little of this
debate has been informed by empirical examination of what construction project planners actually do. The research reported here
draws on three diﬀerent research projects. One on the overall context of construction project planning, and two focused on require-
ments capture for the virtual construction site system. For the later project, 18 construction planners were interviewed on their daily
practice. The results show that construction planning for principal contractors is more about negotiation with other interested par-
ties and rapid decision-making based on heuristics than detailed analysis.
